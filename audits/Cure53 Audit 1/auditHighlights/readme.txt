Differences are stored in highlights.txt. These are labeled according to the issues they resolve.

Other Notes:
other changes have been made to the code between the last audited hash and hash 49d7915666cdc2cd45a7cf8216142a51d1460534
we would like to show that these chages are safe and fairly minor. To highlight this we have moved the snap code into its own directory
the /snap directory. and have begun adapting the new dialog system from METAMASK. These are ongoing changes and hope to highlight interaction
pathways as safe first and foremost.
